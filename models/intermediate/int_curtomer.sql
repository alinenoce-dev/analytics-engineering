    Model: int_customer.sql
    Layer: Intermediate (Data Transformation Layer)
    Project: Adventure Works
    
    Description:
    This intermediate model consolidates the customer registry, unifying information
    from individual consumers (B2C) and retail stores (B2B). It resolves the complex
    normalization of the AdventureWorks OLTP database, delivering unified columns 
    such as 'customer_name' and 'customer_type'.
    
    Lineage:
    - stg_sales_customer: Association keys (pk_person, pk_store)
    - stg_person_person: Registration details for individual physical consumers (B2C)
    - stg_sales_store: Commercial/store names for retail stores (B2B)
