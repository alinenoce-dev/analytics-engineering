    Model: int_sales_reasons_bridge.sql
    Layer: Intermediate (Data Transformation Layer)
    Project: AdventureWorks
    
    Description:
    This bridge table resolves the Many-to-Many (N:M) relationship between sales orders (SalesOrderHeader)
    and their respective sales reasons (SalesReason). It maps each key for 'sales_order' to the corresponding
    Surrogate Key of the sales reason ('sk_sales_reason'), ensuring analytical integrity and preventing
    unwanted duplication (fan-out) in BI reporting tools like Power BI.
    
    Lineage:
    - stg_sales_order_header_sales_reason: OLTP associative mapping table
    - stg_sales_reason: Sales reason master catalog
