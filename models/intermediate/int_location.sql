    Model: int_location.sql
    Layer: Intermediate (Transformation Layer)
    Project: AdventureWorks
    
    Description:
    This intermediate model consolidates geographic data by joining addresses,
    states/provinces, and country/regions. It pre-calculates the surrogate key (sk_location)
    via MD5 hash for downstream use in dim_location.
    
    Lineage:
    - stg_person_address: Base address records (city, postal code, state province ID)
    - stg_person_state_province: State and province metadata (names, country codes)
    - stg_person_country_region: Country and region names
